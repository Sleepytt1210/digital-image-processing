Practices on digital image processing.

## Constant Stretching
Stretches the histogram by picking n percentile of min and max pixel value from the image data. Works on both RGB and Greyscale positive pixels.

## Histogram Equalisation
Equalises the intensity of images by linear interpolating the input pixels onto the cumulative distribution to spread the itensity in a more uniform manner.
